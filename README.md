# Classic Snake Game

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a line, 
typically called a snake, that grows bigger after eating 
\something, typically apples, making the snake a primary 
obstacle to itself. 
The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade 
from Gremlin Industries, and the ease of implementation has led to 
hundreds of versions 
(some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) 
for many platforms. 
1982's Tron arcade game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay 
for the single-player Light Cycles segment. 
After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, 
there was a resurgence of interest in snake games as it found a 
larger audience.
